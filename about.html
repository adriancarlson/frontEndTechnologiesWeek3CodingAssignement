                    <td>Arabica</td>
                    <td>You’re probably already familiar with this commonly produced coffee bean; it accounts for over
                        60% of the world’s coffee
                        production. Arabica beans are grown at high altitudes, in areas that receive steady rainfall and
                        have a plentiful amount
                        of shade. Arabica trees are generally easy to care for as they are relatively small and easy to
                        prune—they are normally
                        no taller than 6′; their small stature also makes harvesting simpler.</td>

                    <td>Robusta</td>
                    <td>You’ve also probably heard of Robusta as it comes second to Arabica as the world’s most produced
                        coffee.
                        <br>
                        Its name is no coincidence. The Robusta varietal is extremely tolerant of its environment and
                        practically immune to
                        disease. Robusta coffee can withstand myriad altitudes, but particularly requires a hot climate
                        where rainfall is
                        irregular. Robusta coffee beans have almost double the amount of caffeine compared to Arabica
                        beans—in fact, caffeine is
                        what makes Robusta plants so robust! Caffeine is the plant’s self-defense against disease.

                    <td>Liberica is harder to come by in the coffee world these days, but this varietal has an important
                        place in the world’s
                        coffee history.
                        <br>
                        In 1890, coffee rust decimated over 90% of the world’s Arabica stock. Scrambling to find a
                        solution, farmers and
                        government agents alike turned to the Liberica plant; the first country to try this was the
                        Philippines (which was a
                        U.S. territory at the time). This decision greatly helped the Philippines’ economy as they were
                        the only coffee supplier
                        for a time.

                    <td>Excelsa</td>
                    <td>Although Excelsa has been recently re-classified as a member of the Liberica family, the two
                        couldn’t be more different;
                        it differs so much from Liberica that some members of the coffee community still think of it as
                        a separate species. It
                        was re-named as a genus of Liberica because it grows on large 20-30 ft trees like Liberica at
                        similar altitudes and has
                        a similar almond-like shape.</td>
